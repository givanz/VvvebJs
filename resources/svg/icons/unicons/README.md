# Unicons

1000+ Pixel-perfect vector icons and Iconfont for your next project. These icons are designed by [Iconscout](https://iconscout.com).

## Getting Started

### Using as a font

It's easy to use Unicons on your website by just inserting following css. You can also download this repo and use the css from `css` folder.

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unicons.iconscout.com/release/v4.0.0/css/unicons.css"
/>
```

And use the icons in your `body` as below.

```html
<i class="uil uil-comments"></i>
```

### Using as npm package

You can easily install [Unicons](https://iconscout.com/unicons) using npm.

```bash
npm install --save @iconscout/unicons
```

### Using as an SVG

If you're a designer then it's always great to have SVG files. You can download SVGs from [Official Unicons Website](https://iconscout.com/unicons) or [download Icondrop](https://iconscout.com/icondrop) to access these icons right into Sketch, Adobe Xd, Adobe Illustrator, and many more.

### Using in Flutter Framework

There's a Flutter package created by [Pedro Lemos](https://github.com/pedrolemoz), avaliable in [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/unicons), which can be easily used in your project.

Just add the dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file as following:

```yaml
dependencies:
  unicons: ^1.0.0+2
```

Then, run the command above:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Alternatively, your editor might support `flutter pub get`. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

Now, in your Dart code, import the package:

```dart
import 'package:unicons/unicons.dart';
```
